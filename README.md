## Description

Notifies (via email) the teachers and optionally the learners when a button is pressed. You can change the text on the button. You would normally also use restriction requirements to ensure this activity is only accessible at the right time.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement the ability for the user to add their signature (using https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad).
- [ ] Fix up the list all page so that it is useful ...
